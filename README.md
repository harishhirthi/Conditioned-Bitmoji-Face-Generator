# Conditioned-Bitmoji-Face-Generator
Interesting Topic as a part of **Generative AI** to generate different Bitmoji Faces based on Gender condition.

## Description:
***Conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network [CDCGANS]***, another type of a prominent network for approaching Generative AI, built with Pytorch to generate new and 
artificial Bitmoji Faces. These GANs introduce the conditional version of generative adversarial nets, which can be constructed by simply feeding the data, labels, that we 
wish to condition on to both the generator and discriminator.
